# Now-you-cannot-make-excuse-for-not-reciting-words
This is just an exercise for C#, it's designed for reciting JLPT-2 words.
The program's generality is poor, it's neccessary to prepare a .csv file (and the words must be specially formatted) named "N2" and a text file named "track".
The favorite function is not available, perhaps some day I will add that.
